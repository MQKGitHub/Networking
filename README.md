## 🌐 Networking 

This section of my TryHackMe journey explores the backbone of modern communication: networking. From foundational models like OSI/TCP-IP to protocol analysis with Wireshark and offensive tools like Nmap, these concepts are critical for cybersecurity, penetration testing, and system administration.  

Each topic builds layered knowledge—from theory to practical packet-level insights.
