## 🌐 Networking 

This section of my TryHackMe journey explores the backbone of modern communication: networking. From foundational models like OSI/TCP-IP to protocol analysis with Wireshark and offensive tools like Nmap, these concepts are critical for cybersecurity, penetration testing, and system administration.  

Each topic builds layered knowledge—from theory to practical packet-level insights.

### 🧠 Overview  

#### 📡 Networking Concepts  
- Gained a foundational understanding of networking by exploring the OSI and TCP/IP models, IP addressing, subnetting, and the differences between TCP and UDP protocols.  
- Practised analysing packet encapsulation and learned how data traverses networks, setting the stage for deeper exploration into network security and communication protocols.

#### 🔌 Networking Essentials  
- Explored key networking protocols such as DHCP, ARP, ICMP, NAT, and routing to understand how devices communicate and configure themselves on a network.  
- Practised using tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and Wireshark to analyse packet flow and troubleshoot connectivity issues.

#### 📨  Networking Core Protocols  
- Explored essential networking protocols like DNS, HTTP, FTP, and SMTP to understand how they support core internet functions.  
- Practised using tools like `nslookup`, `whois`, and `telnet` to interact with services directly and inspect real-time network communication.

#### 🔒 Networking Secure Protocols  
- Learned how secure protocols like TLS, SSH, and VPNs protect network communication through encryption and authentication.  
- Explored how plaintext services are upgraded (e.g. HTTP → HTTPS) and analysed secure traffic using tools like Wireshark and OpenSSH.

#### 🦈 Wireshark: The Basics  
- Learned how to load, view, and analyse network traffic using Wireshark’s GUI and PCAP files.  
- Explored filters, packet dissection, expert info, and stream following to identify and understand traffic patterns.
