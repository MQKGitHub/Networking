## 🌐 Networking 

This section of my TryHackMe journey explores the backbone of modern communication: networking. From foundational models like OSI/TCP-IP to protocol analysis with Wireshark and offensive tools like Nmap, these concepts are critical for cybersecurity, penetration testing, and system administration.  

Each topic builds layered knowledge—from theory to practical packet-level insights.

### 🧠 Overview  

#### 📡 Networking Concepts  
- Gained a foundational understanding of networking by exploring the OSI and TCP/IP models, IP addressing, subnetting, and the differences between TCP and UDP protocols.  
- Practised analysing packet encapsulation and learned how data traverses networks, setting the stage for deeper exploration into network security and communication protocols.

#### 🔌 Networking Essentials  
- Explored key networking protocols such as DHCP, ARP, ICMP, NAT, and routing to understand how devices communicate and configure themselves on a network.  
- Practised using tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and Wireshark to analyse packet flow and troubleshoot connectivity issues.
